An exercise designated to show how to refactor code. 
  By reviewing an already provided webpage, the HTML and CSS was inspected and restructed to ensure the following are included:

  *Semantic Elements<br/>
  *Links are working properly
  *Comments before each section
  *Alt attributes of img elements
  *Headers in sequential order
  *Removal of redundant HTML classes

Upon completion, there should be better understanding of how code can be laid out for readability and efficiency
